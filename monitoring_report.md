## Issue Details

### Issue 1
**Timestamp:** 2025-03-13T06:37:35.141531
**Status:** Unresolved
**Error:** [2023-03-07 10:15:45] ERROR: Failed to pull docker image: connection timed out

**Context:**
> [2023-03-07 10:15:23] INFO: Starting build process
> [2023-03-07 10:15:30] INFO: Pulling docker image: myapp:latest
> [2023-03-07 10:15:45] ERROR: Failed to pull docker image: connection timed out
> [2023-03-07 10:16:00] ERROR: Failed to pull docker image: connection timed out

**Solution Applied:**
Based on the log snippet, the most likely cause of the issue is a network connectivity problem or a slow network connection that's preventing the build process from pulling the Docker image from the registry.

To fix this issue, I would take the following steps:

1. **Check network connectivity**: Verify that the build server has a stable and fast network connection to the Docker registry.
2. **Increase the timeout**: Configure the Docker pull command to increase the timeout period to allow for more time to establish a connection to the registry. This can be done by setting the `--pull-timeout` flag or by modifying the Docker configuration file.
3. **Check Docker registry status**: Verify that the Docker registry is up and running and not experiencing any issues. You can check the registry's status page or contact the registry administrators to confirm.
4. **Try an alternative registry mirror**: If the issue persists, try pulling the image from a different registry mirror or a cached image to isolate if the issue is specific to the registry or the network connection.

By taking these steps, you should be able to resolve the connection timeout issue and successfully pull the Docker image.

### Issue 2
**Timestamp:** 2025-03-13T06:37:35.142040
**Status:** Unresolved
**Error:** [2023-03-07 10:16:00] ERROR: Failed to pull docker image: connection timed out

**Context:**
> [2023-03-07 10:15:30] INFO: Pulling docker image: myapp:latest
> [2023-03-07 10:15:45] ERROR: Failed to pull docker image: connection timed out
> [2023-03-07 10:16:00] ERROR: Failed to pull docker image: connection timed out

**Solution Applied:**
Based on the logs, the most likely cause of the issue is that the Docker client is unable to connect to the Docker registry to pull the `myapp:latest` image due to a network connectivity issue.

To fix this issue, I would suggest the following steps:

1. **Check the network connection**: Verify that the machine running the Docker client has a stable network connection and can reach the Docker registry.
2. **Check the Docker registry status**: Ensure that the Docker registry is up and running, and that there are no issues with the registry itself. You can check the registry status using the Docker Hub status page or by contacting the registry administrators.
3. **Increase the timeout**: You can increase the timeout value for the Docker pull command to allow more time for the connection to establish. This can be done by adding the `--timeout` flag to the Docker pull command, for example: `docker pull --timeout 300 myapp:latest` (this sets the timeout to 5 minutes).
4. **Try pulling the image again**: After verifying the network connection and registry status, try pulling the image again using the increased timeout value.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the connection timeout issue and successfully pull the Docker image.
