Setting Up the Environment for the Log Monitoring Agent
Here's a step-by-step approach to set up your environment and run the code:
1. Create a Virtual Environment
```
# Create a project directory
mkdir log-monitoring-agent
cd log-monitoring-agent

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```
2. Install Required Dependencies
```
pip install requests
```
4. Create the Python Script

Create a new file named log_monitor.py
Copy the entire code from the artifact I provided earlier into this file

4. Create a Sample Log File for Testing
```
# Create a directory for logs (if testing locally)
mkdir logs
touch logs/deployment.log

# Add some sample content for testing
echo "[2023-03-07 10:15:23] INFO: Starting build process" >> logs/deployment.log
echo "[2023-03-07 10:15:30] INFO: Pulling docker image: myapp:latest" >> logs/deployment.log
echo "[2023-03-07 10:15:45] ERROR: Failed to pull docker image: connection timed out" >> logs/deployment.log
```
5. Configure the Script
Edit the if __name__ == "__main__" section at the bottom of the script with your specific configuration:
```
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Configuration
    log_path = "logs/deployment.log"  # Path to your log file (use absolute path in production)
    api_key = "your-llm-api-key"  # Your API key for OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.
    api_url = "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions"  # Or Anthropic's endpoint
    kubernetes_context = None  # Set to None for local testing
    app_endpoint = "http://localhost:8080"  # Your application endpoint
    
    # Create and run orchestrator
    orchestrator = AgentOrchestrator(
        log_path=log_path,
        api_key=api_key,
        api_url=api_url,
        kubernetes_context=kubernetes_context,
        application_endpoint=app_endpoint
    )
    
    # Run continuous monitoring
    orchestrator.run_continuous_monitoring(interval_seconds=10)  # Shorter interval for testing
   ```
7. Set Up Access to Your LLM API

Sign up for an API key at OpenAI (https://platform.openai.com/) or Anthropic (https://console.anthropic.com/)
Get your API key from your account dashboard
Add it to the script (in production, use environment variables instead of hardcoding)
```
# Better way to get API key from environment variable
import os
api_key = os.environ.get("LLM_API_KEY")
```
7. Set Up Kubernetes Access (for Production Use)
If you're monitoring a real Kubernetes cluster:
bashCopy# Make sure kubectl is installed
kubectl version

# Configure your kubeconfig file
# Usually located at ~/.kube/config
Update the script with your Kubernetes context name:
```
kubernetes_context = "your-cluster-name"  # From kubectl config get-contexts
```
8. Run the Script
# Activate your virtual environment if not already activated

# On Windows:
```
venv\Scripts\activate
```
# On macOS/Linux:
```
source venv/bin/activate
```
# Run the script
```
python log_monitor.py
```
9. Test the System

In a different terminal, add new log entries:

```
echo "[2023-03-07 11:20:15] ERROR: Pod crashed with exit code 1, out of memory" >> logs/deployment.log
```
The monitoring agent should detect this issue and prompt you for confirmation to apply a fix

10. Production Setup Considerations
For a production environment:

Use a Service Manager: Set up systemd (Linux) or Windows Service to run the script continuously
Environment Variables: Store sensitive information like API keys in environment variables
Logging: Configure more detailed logging to a dedicated log file
Authentication: Use proper authentication for Kubernetes (service accounts)
Secure API Key Storage: Use a secrets manager like HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager
